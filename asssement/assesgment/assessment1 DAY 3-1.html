    <title> MY SUCCESS STORY</title>

    <p><b>ASIS NOVA J</b>The success story that I value the most is my own success story of finishing my education and
        earning my Bachelor Degree. Because for me the road to obtain my degree was difficult and emotional. When I was
        a juvenile I made choices without thinking about the consequences and one decision that I regret the most almost
        cost me everything. When I was seventeen years old and a senior in high school, I hung around with the wrong
        crowd whose only interest was having a social life and having fun. The decision that I made that almost cost me
        everything was overdosing during school hours and being rushed to the hospital because of my action. The school
        called my parents saying, “Your son has overdose on drugs and his condition was life threaten to rush over the
        hospital as soon as they can”. After being at the hospital for twenty-four hours I was finally able to leave and
        had to face the consequence of my action</p>
